# Word Guesser

### WIP Project

The main goal of this project is to create an application using:

- React
- Redux
- Redux Thunk

And test it using:

- Jest
- Enzyme

The applocation aims to help me to improve my Jest knowledge, working directly with mockStore, direct with the middleware.

The idea of this project came from Bonnie Schulkin' Udemy Course.
